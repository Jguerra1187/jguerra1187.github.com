<p>I am currently 16, now an offiial senior in high school and I'm in marching band.</p>

<p>This will be a very simple web page that that will use images that I provide for you. <i><b>I do not care what you write about</b></i> it can be about personal interests etc.. (Keep it clean! LOL) Do not simply use text such as hello world.</p>

<hr/>
<p>Make sure that your first webpage incorporates the assignment criteria somehow within the webpage. If you create more than one page you will need to include these same criteria both pages. </p>

<p>Open your text editor  create a new file</p>
<p>Once the file is open go to file --> select save as --> rename your file to --><a href="#"><button> basic.html</button></a> <br/>save your file inside of Day 1 folder.</p>
<p>Leave your text editor open so that you are ready to begin working on the assignment.</p>
